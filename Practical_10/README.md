1. My accuracy in estimating practical tasks definitely improved as the course progressed. Initially, I struggled with accurately predicting the time needed for certain tasks. However, as I gained more experience and became more familiar with the work and the tools, my estimates became more accurate. One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. This made it easier to estimate the time required for each component. Additionally, I learned to consider potential obstacles or delays that could affect the completion time, which further improved the accuracy of my estimates over time.
2. Participating in code reviews was an invaluable learning experience for me. Being reviewed helped me improve my coding skills significantly. I learned new techniques, best practices, and gained a better understanding of how to write clean, efficient code. On the other hand, doing code reviews taught me how to analyze code critically, identify potential issues, and provide constructive feedback. It also helped me understand different coding styles and techniques, ultimately making me a better programmer.
3. If I were in charge of the subject, there are several changes I would consider. Firstly, I would place more emphasis on teaching students how to break down tasks effectively, as this is crucial for accurate estimation. Additionally, I would implement regular feedback sessions where students can discuss their estimates, review their work, and learn from their mistakes. Moreover, I would incorporate more real-world scenarios into the practical tasks to better prepare students for actual work environments. Finally, I would place a greater emphasis on code reviews, as they are essential for improving coding skills and learning best practices. Overall, these changes would better prepare students for real-world software development work.
